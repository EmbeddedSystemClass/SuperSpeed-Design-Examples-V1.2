# SuperSpeed-Design-Examples-V1.2
SuperSpeed Design Examples V1.2 From John Hyde's book - **Superspeed Device Design by Example**.

This book is *really* great, but all Visual Studio projects were a little out-of-date, so I retarget/recompile with Visual Studio 2017 Community on Windows 10. The rest (FX3 firmware & CLPD) are the same.
